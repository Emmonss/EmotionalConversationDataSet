# Introduction
We colloected three conversation data sets: chat-robot, cornell_chinese and english dialogue. Those data sets are collected from web.

We labeled them with five emotional tag in the expectation of further emotion computing research. These dialogues are tagged with five kinds of emotions, which we define as follows: 0: neutral; 1: happy; 2: surprised; 3: Grief; and 4: angry.

Different data sets are collected and labelled by different people at different times. So, the format of different data sets are various.
